<!-- AOS (Animate On Scroll) Library in JavaScript
## Overview
    AOS (Animate On Scroll) is a lightweight and easy-to-use JavaScript
    library that adds animations to elements as they scroll into view. It
    enables developers to create engaging and interactive web pages
    with minimal effort.

### Key Features of AOS:

    - Ease of Use: Simple initialization and usage with HTML data attributes.
    - Customizable Animations**: Supports a wide range of animations and allows custom configurations.
    - Responsive and Optimized: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes and is optimized for performance.
    - No Dependencies: Does not require jQuery or other libraries.


## How AOS Works

    -AOS uses data attributes in HTML to define the type of animation, its
    duration, delay, offset, and other properties. When an element is
    scrolled into view, the specified animation is triggered, making it
    appear more dynamic and interactive.

    
## Steps to Use AOS

    1. Include AOS in Your Project
        You can include AOS using a CDN or by downloading the library.
        Using CDN:
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css">
            <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.js"></script>

    ## Downloading the Library: ( Alternative way)
        Download the AOS library from its GitHub repository and include the CSS and JS files in your project.

    2. Add AOS Attributes to HTML Elements
        Add `data-aos` attributes to the elements you want to animate. 
        
        For example:
            <div data-aos="fade-up"> This element will fade up as you scroll. </div>
    
    3. Initialize AOS in JavaScript
        Initialize the library by adding the following code to your JavaScript file or a <script> tag:
            AOS.init();
        
        Example: Simple Animation on Scroll
            Here is a complete example demonstrating how to use AOS:-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>AOS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css">
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        .box {
            width: 300px;
            height: 300px;
            margin: 50px auto;
            background-color: #4CAF50;
            color: white;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">AOS Library
        Example</h1>
    <div data-aos="fade-up" class="box">Fade Up</div>
    <div data-aos="fade-down" class="box">Fade Down</div>
    <div data-aos="zoom-in" class="box">Zoom In</div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.js"></script>
    <script>
        AOS.init();
    </script>
</body>

</html>
<!-- Explanation:

1. HTML Structure : Each div has a data-aos attribute specifying the animation type.

2. CSS Styles : Simple styling is applied to make the boxes visually distinct.

3. JavaScript Initialization: AOS is initialized using AOS.init() to activate animations.


Configuration Options
    AOS provides several options for customization:

    Example with Custom Configurations:
        AOS.init({
            offset: 200, // Offset (in pixels) from the original trigger point
            duration: 600, // Animation duration (in milliseconds)
            easing: 'ease-in-out', // Animation easing
            delay: 100, // Delay (in milliseconds) between animations
            once: true, // Whether animation should happen only once
        });


## Conclusion

The AOS library is a fantastic tool for adding smooth and
eye-catching animations to your website. Its simplicity and flexibility
make it a favorite choice among developers. Experiment with different
animation types and configurations to create unique effects for your
projects. -->
